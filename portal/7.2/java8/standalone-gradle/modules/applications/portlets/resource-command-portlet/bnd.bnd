# Use the common Bnd instructions such as bundle name and version
-include: ./common.bnd

# Because `compileInclude` is used to define the dependency to poi-ooxml.jar in `build.gradle`
# and we are using the Liferay's plugin in gradle, we do not need to add the -includeresource
# attribute, and the poi-ooxml.jar and any other depedencies are automatically included in the
# resulting jar. (see Option 4 explained in https://liferay.dev/blogs/-/blogs/osgi-module-dependencies)
# Also see https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/adding-third-party-libraries-to-a-module#embedding-libraries-in-a-module
# to learn how external dependencies can be included in your bundle

# Since we are using Liferay's plugin in Gradle, the following is automatically taken care of
#   - Instruct Bnd to use portalble contracts instead of package dependencies, when possible
#   - Add a plugin to analyze the JSPs
#   - Add a plugin to analyze i18n resource bundles
#   - Add a plugin to analyze SASS/CSS files
